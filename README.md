# HARDWARE COMPILER

## This project focuses on fixing the inefficiencies of running machine code on a computer
        - Basically, the idea is to turn a program into an ASIC. 
        - Since all programs can technically be converted into hardware, I would like to push the limit

## The final goal of the project is to convert the linux kernel into hardware
        - For now, the goal is to convert assembly code (probably linux x86 code for now) into its corresponding hardware

## Challenges
        - I am not a hardware expert or electrical engineer

## Ideas
        - It may be possible to use analog signals for even faster processing (I would like to see an analog AI model)
